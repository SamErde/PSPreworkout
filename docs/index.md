## Inspiration

Why **PSPreworkout**? Whether you are developing PowerShell code or performing daily tasks, the goal of PSPreworkout is to start working efficiently as quickly as possible. The idea for the name was inspired by the pre-workout mix that I sometimes drink for an extra kick of energy and focus before working out.

The **PSPreworkout** module contains shortcuts for setting up a PowerShell environment, configuring Git, customizing the shell, working with environment variables, creating new script files from a template, updating packages, and more!

## Getting Started

```powershell
Install-Module -Name PSPreworkout -Scope CurrentUser
Get-Command -Module PSPreworkout
```
